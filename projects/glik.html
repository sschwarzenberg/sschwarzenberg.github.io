        <h3>GLIK</h3>

        <p>Glik is a web and mobile application to track the development of diabetes in patients. The project was created by doctors of Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica to be used in Red UC Christus.  
        </p>  
        <p> For designing the project i had to study both the behavior of doctors, patients (mostly seniors) and caregivers  to make a platform that would cover the needs of all types of users. The two main parts of the project are described below:
        </p>    
        <p> <b>a. Web platform:</b> Used by teams of healthcare workers. Its objective is to report the patient's conditions, enter and consult the results of medical exams, oversee physical activity, manage medications, visualize fundamental information about the disease, and help monitor the patient's progress. It should also work as a platform for managing doctors and medical centers related to patients with diabetes by one or more administrators.
        </p>  
        
        </div>
        <div class="col m-5">
            <p><b>b. Mobile App :</b> The mobile application is aimed at patients and caregivers. The application's objective is to help monitor patients, provide them with important and necessary information, motivate them to follow healthier lifestyles that help control the disease, and collect data that will be used to analyze individual health conditions. In order to achieve this, the platform must be integrated with a glucometer attached to the patient's skin for it to record blood glucose levels continuously and in real time. Both parts of the system work together in order to generate a monitoring, care and communication platform for type II diabetes. Patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals are included in a cycle of data entry, alerts, recommendations and continuous monitoring to reduce the risks associated with the disease.
